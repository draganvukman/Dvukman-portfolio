                    Where I live, in southwest Germany, there are a bewildering
                    number of shoe stores that specialize in barefoot-style
                    footwear. I’ve counted at least four Barfußschuhläden within
                    a mile of my home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’ve asked my local friends about this, and they shrug and
                    say things like “Freiburg is an eco-city” or “People here
                    like to feel close to nature.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’d noticed. Last weekend, my kids and I were walking in the
                    Black Forest when we passed a woman hiking barefoot. My
                    eight-year-old is an inveterate gawker, and he stopped and
                    stared at her as though she were insane. Patiently,
                    smilingly, she explained to him the pleasures of walking
                    barefoot, especially outdoors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That encounter motivated me explore the latest peer-reviewed
                    research on minimalist shoes and barefoot walking. After a
                    few hours of reading, I started to think I was the crazy one
                    for binding up my poor feet in thick layers of leather,
                    rubber, and molded plastic.

                  <div class="special-text-box">
                    A 2021 study found that people who switched to minimalist
                    shoes for six months increased their foot strength by nearly
                    60%.

                    Kristiaan D’Août, PhD, is a senior lecturer in evolutionary
                    biomechanics at the University of Liverpool in the U.K. He
                    has published more than a dozen papers on barefoot
                    locomotion and barefoot-style footwear.

                  <p>
                    When we spoke earlier this week, he told me that more work
                    is needed to iron out the pros and cons of barefoot running.
                    But when it comes to walking, it’s clear that more of us
                    should spend time each day barefoot or in minimalist
                    footwear.

                    The problems with conventional shoes are numerous and
                    well-documented.

                    has linked to both discomfort and assorted injuries. Most
                    shoes are also too narrow, especially in the toe box, which
                    D’Août says compresses the foot and over time can cause
                    bunions and other deformities. Many shoes provide arch
                    support, which seems useless — at best. “The idea that the
                    arches of healthy people need supporting is something I’ve
                    never found any evidence for,” he says. “Based on our
                    anatomy, it’s probably a bad thing.”

                    He mentions an influential

                    from an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, Daniel Lieberman,
                    PhD. That study concluded that a more natural running style,
                    facilitated by running barefoot or in minimalist shoes,
                    could “protect the feet and lower limbs from some of the
                    impact-related injuries now experienced by a high percentage
                    of runners.”

                  <div class="special-text-box">
                    Running aside, most of us would benefit from a daily walk
                    barefoot or in minimalist footwear.

                    Separately, there are those who believe barefoot contact
                    with the ground — often referred to as “grounding” or
                    “earthing” — may provide important health benefits.

                    When it comes to running on flat, hard surfaces — something
                    that may be good for your heart and overall health but
                    ultimately bad for your feet and joints — researchers are
                    still debating whether barefoot or minimalist footwear is
                    superior to conventional running shoes. For runners, the
                    “right” style of shoe may vary depending on a person’s
                    weight, age, running habits, and injury history.

                  <p>
                    f you want to run in barefoot-style shoes — or just plain
                    barefoot — D’Août says you should make the change gradually.
                    “Start with one session a week and make it really short,
                    just five-to-10 minutes,” he advises. From there, you can
                    work your way up to longer or more intense runs. “The older
                    you are and the more vigorous the activity, the more you
                    need to take it slow,” he says.

                    Running aside, D’Août says most of us would benefit from a
